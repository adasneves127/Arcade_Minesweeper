    """Object for storing a Tiled map with all associated objects.

    This object is the top level object for a map. It contains all layers within a map,
    as well as all Tiesets used by the map. When creating an implementation, this will
    be the primary class to work with to pull all data relating to a map.

    Attributes:
        infinite: If the map is infinite or not.
        layers: List of layer objects by draw order.
        map_size: The map width in tiles.
        next_layer_id: Stores the next available ID for new layers.
        next_object_id: Stores the next available ID for new objects.
        orientation: Map orientation. Tiled supports "orthogonal", "isometric",
            "staggered" and "hexagonal"
        render_order: The order in which tiles on tile layers are rendered. Valid values
            are right-down, right-up, left-down and left-up. In all cases, the map is
            drawn row-by-row. (only supported for orthogonal maps at the moment)
        tiled_version: The Tiled version used to save the file. May be a date (for
            snapshot builds).
        tile_size: The size of a tile.
        tilesets: Dict of Tileset where Key is the firstgid and the value is the Tileset
        version: The JSON format version.
        background_color: The background color of the map.
        properties: The properties of the Map.
        hex_side_length: Only for hexagonal maps. Determines the width or height
            (depending on the staggered axis) of the tile's edge, in pixels.
        stagger_axis: For staggered and hexagonal maps, determines which axis ("x" or
            "y") is staggered.
        stagger_index: For staggered and hexagonal maps, determines whether the "even"
            or "odd" indexes along the staggered axis are shifted.
        class_: The Tiled class of this Map.
        parallax_origin: The point on the map to center the parallax scrolling of layers on.
